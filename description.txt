In memory of the old calamity zerg potion...

Primal zerg is a mod to increase the spawn rate and spawn cap to crazy amount

Current Version :

- Swarm creep concoction : Increase the spawn rate and the spawn cap by a lot ( by default it's 150 )

- You can craft the swarm creep concoction with a bottledWater, 6 gel, 6 souls of night and 6 ichor or cursed flame.

- You can modify the spawn rate and spawn cap boost of the concoction with this command : /PrimalZergCreepSpawnRate spawnRate , /PrimalZergCreepSpawnCap spawnCap 

- And their shorcut : /PZCSpawnRate spawnRate , /PZCSpawnCap spawnCap

Futur update : 

- A zerg invasion where you can choose the spawn rate and cap. Complete the invasion without dying to increase the concoction effect maximum value.
